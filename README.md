# Tech Stack

React, CSS, Tailwind

# Features

1. Add Task
2. Edit Task
3. Set Task Status to "Completed" or "Canceled"
4. Set Time Schedule
5. Stored data to local storage
6. Reset

# Issues

1. The Reset Button handler uses window.location.reload(). This is not a good thing to do in react. 
Solution : The taskList has to be kept as a state value. I will do it when I get free, as some minor complications may arise. 
Or, if anybody is interested in contributing, can send me an email.
